rdt and rdtLite
===============

This repository contains R source code and associated files for rdt
and rdtLite. These tools collect provenance as an R script executes or during
an R console session and store the provenancee in PROV-JSON format for use
by other applications. rdtLite is a streamlined tool that will meet the needs 
of most users. rdt is a research tool that uses an annotated 
version of the original R script to collect provenance for statements
inside functions and control constructs.
