rdt and rdtLite
===============

This repository contains R source code and associated files for rdt and rdtLite. These tools collect provenance as an R script executes or during an R console session and store the provenance in PROV-JSON format for use by other applications. rdtLite is a streamlined tool that will meet the needs of most users. rdt is a research tool that uses an annotated version of the original R script to collect provenance for statements inside functions and control constructs. rdt and rdtLite belong to a collection of [R Tools](https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/End-to-end-provenance.github.io/blob/master/RTools.md) developed as part of a larger project on [End-to-end-provenance](https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/End-to-end-provenance.github.io/blob/master/README.md).
