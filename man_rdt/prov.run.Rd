\arguments{
\item{prov.dir}{the directory where the provenance graph will be 
saved. If not provided, the directory specified by the prov.dir 
option is used. Otherwise the R session temporary directory
is used.}

\item{overwrite}{if FALSE, includes a time stamp in the provenance
graph directory name.}

\item{details}{if TRUE, provenance is collected for each top-level
statement.}

\item{annotate.inside.functions}{if TRUE, provenance is collected 
inside functions.}

\item{first.loop}{the first loop to collect provenance in a for, 
while, or repeat statement.}

\item{max.loops}{the maximum number of loops to collect
provenance in a for, while, or repeat statement. If max.loops = -1,
there is no limit. If max.loops = 0, no loops are annotated. 
If non-zero, it indicates the number of iterations of each loop for
which provenance should be collected.  If max.loops is non-zero, provenance
is also collected inside if-statements.}

\item{snapshot.size}{the maximum size for snapshot files. If 0,
no snapshots are saved. If Inf, the complete state of an object is stored
in the snapshot file. For other values, the head of the object, truncated
to a size near the specified limit, is saved.  The size is in kilobytes.}

\item{hash.algorithm}{the hash algorithm to use for files.
Choices are md5 (default), sha1, crc32, sha256, sha512, xxhash32, 
xxhash64 and murmur32. This feature uses the digest function from 
the digest package.}

\item{save.debug}{If TRUE, debug files are saved to the debug directory.
This is intended for developers of the rdt / rdtLite package.}

\item{r.script.path}{the full path to the R script file that is being 
executed. A copy of the script will be saved with the provenance graph.}

\item{display}{if TRUE, the provenance graph is displayed in DDG Explorer}

\item{file}{the name of the R script file to source.}
}
\value{
prov.init initializes the provenance collector.  The prov.init
function does not return a value.

prov.save writes the current provenance to a file but does not 
  return a value.

prov.quit writes the current provenance to a file but does not 
  return a value.

prov.run runs a script, collecting provenance as it does so.  
  It does not return a value.

The prov.source function does not return a value.
}
\description{
prov.init intializes a new provenance graph. This function can be
executed in the console or placed inside an R script.

prov.save saves the current provenance graph to a prov-json file.
If more R statements are executed, the provenance for these statements
is added to the graph. The graph is finalized with prov.quit.
This function can be
executed in the console or placed inside an R script.

prov.quit saves and closes the current provenance graph.
This function can be
executed in the console or placed inside an R script.

prov.run initiates execution of a script and collects provenance as 
the script executes.  This function should be used if you want to 
collect provenance for a script that is in an R file and you do not
want to modify the R script directly to include calls to prov.init, 
prov.save and prov.quit.  It essentially wraps the execution of the 
script with calls to prov.init and prov.quit.

prov.source loads an R script and executes it, collecting provenance
as it does so.  It assumes that provenance has already been initialized,
either via a call to prov.init, or because the R script was executed
using prov.run.  If you want to collect provenance inside scripts
that are loaded with R's source function, you should replace calls 
to source with calls to prov.source.
}
\details{
rdt is an R package that collects provenance as an R script 
executes. The resulting provenance provides a detailed record of the 
execution of the script and includes information on the steps that were 
performed and the intermediate data values that were created. The 
resulting provenance can be used for a wide variety of applications
that include debugging scripts, cleaning code, and reproducing results.

There are two ways in which a user can collect provenance.  To collect
provenance from commands stored in a script file, use prov.run.  This
will execute the commands that are in the script, collecting provenance
as it does so.

The user can also collect provenance while executing commands in the 
console.  To do this, first execute prov.init.  Then enter console
commands as normal.  When done with the commands for which you want
provenance, use prov.quit.  If you want to save the current provenance
without turning off provenance collection, call prov.save instead of
prov.quit.  You can call prov.save multiple times before calling prov.quit.
Each call will append to the same provenance file.

The provenance is stored in PROV-JSON format. For immediate use it may
be retrieved from memory using the prov.json function. For later use
the provenance is also written to the file prov.json. This file and
associated files are written by default to the R session temporary
directory. The user can change this location by (1) using the optional
parameter prov.dir in the prov.run or prov.init functions, or (2) setting
the prov.dir option (e.g. by using the R options command or editing the
Rprofile.site or .Rprofile file). If prov.dir is set to ".", the current working
directory is used.

The level of detail collected by rdt may be set using parameters
of the prov.run and prov.init functions. Options include collecting
provenance inside functions and inside control constructs and saving
snapshots of large intermediate values as separate files. These
features are turned off by default to optimize performance. Common
settings for the level of detail can also be set and managed using the 
prov.set.detail and related functions.

If prov.source is called when provenance is not initialized, it
will just source the file.  No provenance will be collected.
