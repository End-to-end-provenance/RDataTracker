# This test is different from other tests as it should be run
# manually to test out the console features.  The user should 
# select the contents of this file in RStudio and click Run.
# 
# You can check if the resulting ddg is correct by running:
# ant -file tests.xml console
#
# You should examine console output in RStudio manually for errors.
